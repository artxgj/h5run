My 2010 HTML5/JS webapp for tracking my training runs. It was also my first Javascript app.

The app was first written in 2009 as Geolocation recorder. It went through several iterations of changes. Some of them were:

1. Adding Google Maps API to show maps of the routes ran.
2. Storing the real-time geolocation data in Google App Engine. I gave a [presentation](https://www.meetup.com/sviphone/events/12372267/) about this feature in 2010. 
3. Replaceing the Google App Engine feature with the mobile browser's SQLite; this slowed down the battery-drain of the phone.

For a month in 2010, the app was tested using 3 different devices on three different cellular networks:
1. iPhone 3G on AT&T.
2. A Motorola Android phone on Verizon Wireless.
3. An Evo Android phone on Sprint.

Google I/O 2010's partners gave away the android phones for free and provided a month of free wireless service.
